Overview

This repository offers a cybersecurity dataset comprising 10,000 malicious domain names from OpenPhish and an equally sized benign dataset from Alexa. Additionally, a fictional registration domain list aids in identifying patterns with new domains.
Composition

    Labeled domain list:
        10,000 unique malicious domains which collected from OpenPhish live feed and 10,000 benign domains from Alexa dataset which randomly selected the last 50,000 of Alexa.

Preprocessing

    Excluded Top-Level Domains (TLDs):
        Standardized datasets by focusing on core domain names.

    Duplicate Removal:
        Ensured dataset integrity with no duplicate entries.

Usage

Explore and leverage this dataset for cybersecurity research. The refined datasets and preprocessing steps provide a solid foundation for analysis and experimentation.
