Overview

This repository offers a cybersecurity dataset comprising 10,000 malicious domain names from OpenPhish and an equally sized benign dataset from Alexa. Additionally, a fictional registration domain list aids in identifying patterns with new domains.
Composition

    Malicious Domain List:
        Derived from 50,000 URLs, refined to 10,000 unique malicious domains.

    Benign Domain List:
        Carefully selected from the latest 100,000 domains in the Alexa dataset.

    Fictional Registrant Domain List:
        Simulates registration patterns using common names from AlexaTop100k.

Preprocessing

    Excluded Top-Level Domains (TLDs):
        Standardized datasets by focusing on core domain names.

    Duplicate Removal:
        Ensured dataset integrity with no duplicate entries.

Usage

Explore and leverage this dataset for cybersecurity research. The refined datasets and preprocessing steps provide a solid foundation for analysis and experimentation.
